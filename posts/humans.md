I had a dream last night that I was a human dog. I know. You're either a human or a dog, right? Yet, somehow I was both. I could talk and eat with people. The thought of putting food into my body was weird at first, but soon I got used to it. It's interesting how at first something is unfamiliar and strange, but then in time it becomes normal and familiar. Maybe everthing is like that. All you need is time.
