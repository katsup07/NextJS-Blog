I had a dream last night that I was a human dog. I know. You're either a human or a dog, right? Yet, somehow I was both. I could talk and eat with people. The thought of putting food into my body was weird at first and I kept dropping it on the floor, but soon I got used to it and improved at eating. It's interesting how at first something is unfamiliar and strange, but as you continue to do it it becomes familiar and you make progress. All you need is time and a little practice and you can do just about anything.
